      <h4 style="color:dodgerblue;">Course Description :</h4>
      This course is an introduction to computer programming. Programming is the art of explaining 
      to a computer what you want it to do, in exact detail and in a language that the computer can 
      understand. Programming is only one part of computer science, but it is the most basic and 
      most central part. It is an activity that requires you to think logically, to solve problems, 
      to express yourself clearly, and often to endure a certain amount of frustration as you try
      to get your programs to work. The result, though, can be very rewarding. Many different 
      languages are used for writing computer programs. Fortunately, it is possible to learn
      the principles and general techniques of programming that can be applied no matter 
      what language you write in. Although you will work with a specific language, 
      you should try not to lose sight of the general ideas. In this course, we will 
      use the Java programming language. Java is a relatively new language, having been 
      introduced in 1995. In the years since its introduction, it has become one of the 
      most important languages for real application development. It is a very versatile 
      language. Java can be used to write regular desktop applications and to make "applets" 
      that can appear on Web pages. Many complex interactive Web sites are written in Java,
      and it can be used to write applications for many types of mobile phones. 
      Even high-performance scientific programming has been done in Java.

      The course Operating Systems I is the first of two courses designed to explain the
       intricacies of modern operating systems to the students. Throughout this course,
        students will be learning about the basic structure of an operating system in 
        detail. There are the three key ideas we’re going to learn about over the course of 
        OS1 and OS2: <span>virtualization, concurrency,</span> and <span>persistence</span>. 
        In learning about these ideas, we’ll learn all about how an operating system works, 
        including how it decides what program to run next on a CPU, how it handles memory 
        overload in a virtual memory system, how virtual machine monitors work, 
        how to manage information on disks, and even a little about how to build a 
        distributed system that works when parts of them have failed.  OS1 will 
        focus entirely on the Windows O/S and <span>Virtualization</span>.
         OS2 will continue with the concepts of <span>concurrency</span>, and 
         <span>persistence</span> and focus on the Linux operating system.

  <p>
      <h4 style="color:dodgerblue;">Course Description :</h4>
      This course is an introduction to computer systems. In this course we will begin by 
      exploring the internal design and functionality of the most basic computer components.
       From there, we will use an online hardware simulator to actually “build” a computer 
       and develop an assembler from the ground using concepts we will learn in the class. 
       In the process, we will cover the ideas and techniques used in the design of modern 
       computer hardware and discuss major trade-offs involved in system design as well as 
       future trends in computer architecture and how those trends might affect tomorrow’s 
       computers.

   <p>
      <h4 style="color:dodgerblue;">Course Description :</h4>
      This course presents students with basic concepts in statistics and probability, and 
      encourages statistical thinking. This course is intended to bring students to a level
       where they can carry out simple statistical analysis of simple data. Topics covered 
       include descriptive statistics, probability, discrete and continuous random variables,
        the sampling distribution and the Central Limit Theorem. The R statistical programming
         environment is used for computation, graphical presentation, and simulations. 
         The emphasis in the course is on the presentation of statistical methods and on 
         the interpretation of the outcome. The philosophy of statistics, and not its
          mathematics, is at the center of this course; needed mathematical concepts are
           demonstrated via simulations rather than by abstract proofs.

        with clinical issues, such as abnormal psychology, but it encompasses many different 
        aspects of our lives from individual development, social interactions, 
        and physiological aspects of human behavior. This course serves as an overview of the
         major fields in psychology with an emphasis on empirical evidence on the science of
          human thought and behavior.

<button class="course">Ethics and Social Responsibility &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Grade : B<sup>+</sup> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Point Value : 3.33 </button>
<div class="course-content">

      <h4 style="color:dodgerblue;">Course Description :</h4>
   <p>
      This course intends to teach how ethics is involved in determining the value and meaning 
      of individual and collective actions across a variety of business contexts. Being based 
      on an open access edition of Business Ethics, a Creative Commons book made available to
       the general public by 2012 Book Archive initiative, this course reflects a case study 
       approach to teaching ethics as a philosophical subject that can be relevant to making 
       career choices, job-related decisions and evaluative judgments. Therefore, it is hoped 
       that in this course you will find applications and illustrations of Business Ethics 
       concepts in relation to real-life ethical dilemmas, business world topics, and specific 
       case studies that call for independent thinking and ethical argumentation. As an online 
       resource, the textbook that this course is based upon is periodically updated with links 
       to current discussions and events, which ensures its continued relevance.
  </p>
      <p>
        The approach of Ethics and Social Responsibility adheres to the scope and sequence of a 
        typical introductory business ethics course that relates ethical theories of philosophy
         to the questions typically found in the economic world. In addition to a comprehensive 
         coverage of key theories of ethics, business situations in which they
          are regularly applied, and representative case studies that can be found
           in reading materials, student assignments for this course are organized 
           around engaging questions, discussions that help students apply 
           the ethical theories, and moral issues that advance learners toward the understanding
            of business ethics in meaningful ways.

      </p>
      <p>
        Although the text of the original course book was reorganized to suit the needs of this 
        course, different chapters of the course book are organized around topics that are
         introduced sequentially, to enable a comprehensive, workshop-like acquisition of ethical
          reasoning skills. The course is designed to acquaint students with: (1) 
          What Business Ethics is, (2) Different theories of ethics as tools for decision making,
           (3) Critical perspectives on ethical decisions, (4) Workplace related ethical issues, 
           and (5) Various tenets of corporate social responsibility.
        In this course, each unit will also contain additional readings 
        that will be specified either in the Reading Assignments or in Learning Journal 
        Assignments. Likewise, the Self-Quiz questions that are found at the end of each 
        unit are aimed at expanding the understanding of ethical issues and social
         responsibility topics that are covered by the reading materials. By contrast, 
         the Graded Quiz and Final Exam questions will test the knowledge of the most 
         important aspects of the required textbook materials.
